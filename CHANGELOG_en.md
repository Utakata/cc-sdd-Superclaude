## Ver 0.2.0 (July 26, 2025 Update)

### Interactive Approval System

**Approval Flow Improvements**
- `/spec-design [feature-name]` now displays "Have you reviewed requirements.md? [y/N]" confirmation prompt
- `/spec-tasks [feature-name]` now displays review confirmation for both requirements and design
- 'y' approval automatically updates spec.json and proceeds to next phase
- 'N' selection stops execution and prompts for review

**Simplified Operations**
- Previous: Manual editing of spec.json file required to set `"approved": true`
- Current: Simple response to confirmation prompt completes approval
- Manual approval method remains available

### Specification Generation Quality Improvements

**Enhanced requirements.md Generation**
- EARS format output now generates in more unified format
- Hierarchical requirement structure outputs in more organized format
- Improved comprehensiveness and specificity of acceptance criteria

**Enhanced design.md**
- Technical research process now integrated into design phase
- Requirements mapping and traceability reflected in design documents
- Improved document structure for architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, ERDs
- More detailed descriptions of security, performance, and testing strategies

**Improved tasks.md**
- Implementation tasks optimized for code generation LLMs
- Test-driven development approach integrated into each task
- Clearer management of inter-task dependencies
- Improved to independent prompt format aligned with Kiro design principles

### Fixed Issues

**Improved Directory Handling**
- Now works properly even when `.kiro/steering/` directory doesn't exist
- More user-friendly error messages

**Improved Internal File Management**
- Excluded development prompt files from version control

### System Design Simplification

**Removed progress Field**
- Completely removed redundant progress field that caused sync errors
- Achieved clearer state management with only phase + approvals
- Simplified spec.json structure and improved maintainability

**Revised Requirements Generation Approach**
- Reverted from overly comprehensive requirements generation to original Kiro design
- Removed forceful expressions like "CRITICAL" and "MUST"
- Changed to gradual requirements generation focused on core functionality
- Restored natural development flow premised on iterative improvement

## Usage

1. Copy **`.claude/commands/` directory** and **`CLAUDE.md` file** to your project
2. Run `/kiro:steering` in Claude Code to configure project information
3. Create new specifications with `/kiro:spec-init [feature-name]`
4. Progress through development step by step: requirements → design → tasks

For detailed usage instructions, see [README_en.md](README_en.md).
