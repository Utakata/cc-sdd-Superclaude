# Requirements Document

## Introduction
The Photo Album Application provides users with an intuitive way to organize and manage their digital photo collections. The system allows users to create date-based albums, reorganize them through drag-and-drop functionality, and browse photos within each album using a tile-based preview interface. This solution addresses the need for simple, visual photo organization without complex hierarchical structures.
